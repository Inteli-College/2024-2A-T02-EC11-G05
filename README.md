When working with Git, it's important to maintain clear and consistent commit messages to ensure that the project history is easily understandable. A popular standard for writing Git commit messages is based on the **Conventional Commits** specification. Below are some of the most common types and prefixes used in this standard:

### 1. **Types of Commit Messages**

- **feat:** A new feature for the user.
  - Example: `feat: add user authentication module`
- **fix:** A bug fix.
  - Example: `fix: resolve null pointer exception in login flow`
- **chore:** Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation.
  - Example: `chore: update dependencies`
- **docs:** Documentation only changes.
  - Example: `docs: add API usage instructions`
- **style:** Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
  - Example: `style: reformat code to comply with linter`
- **refactor:** A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
  - Example: `refactor: optimize data processing algorithm`
- **perf:** A code change that improves performance.
  - Example: `perf: reduce API response time by caching results`
- **test:** Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
  - Example: `test: add unit tests for user service`
- **ci:** Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts.
  - Example: `ci: update CI configuration for Docker`
- **build:** Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
  - Example: `build: switch to webpack for bundling`
- **revert:** Reverts a previous commit.
  - Example: `revert: revert "feat: add user authentication module"`

### 2. **Structure of a Commit Message**

A typical commit message following the Conventional Commits standard would have the following structure:

```plaintext
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

- **type:** The type of change (e.g., feat, fix, docs, etc.).
- **scope:** A noun describing a section of the codebase impacted by the commit (optional).
- **subject:** A short, imperative mood description of the change.

### 3. **Examples**

- **feat(auth):** add OAuth 2.0 support for Google login
- **fix(cart):** correct total price calculation in cart service
- **docs(readme):** update contributing guidelines with new branch naming convention
- **style(lint):** fix ESLint warnings in server.js
- **refactor(api):** move business logic to separate service layer
- **test(core):** add integration tests for payment gateway

### 4. **Best Practices**

- **Use the imperative mood in the subject line:** ("Add" rather than "Added" or "Adding").
- **Limit the subject line to 50 characters.**
- **Capitalize the subject line.**
- **Do not end the subject line with a period.**
- **Use the body to explain the "what" and "why" of the change, not the "how."** This is more applicable for more complex changes.

By adhering to these standards, the commit history becomes more readable and useful for everyone working on the project, especially when generating changelogs or reviewing changes during code reviews.
